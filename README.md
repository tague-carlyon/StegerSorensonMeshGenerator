# Steger-Warming algorithm mesh generator using Point-Jacobi iteration
A hyperbolic grid generation technique. Creates structured grids by solving hyperbolic partial differential equations. Particularly effective for generating grids around complex aerodynamic shapes. Excels at maintaining orthogonality near boundaries.

## Point Jacobi Relaxation
An iterative smoothing technique. Improves grid quality through successive approximations. Updates each node based on neighboring points. Helps eliminate grid distortion and irregularities
